# Q-learning-Agent-Play-Game-Frozen-Lake
Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm used to train agents to make decisions in an environment. 

The algorithm learns a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, by updating a Q-value for each state-action pair. The Q-value represents the expected cumulative future rewards an agent can obtain by taking a specific action in a given state.

FrozenLake environment, which is a classic problem in reinforcement learning. FrozenLake is often used as a benchmark in the OpenAI Gym library. It represents a grid-world environment where an agent needs to navigate from the starting point to the goal while avoiding holes in the ice.
